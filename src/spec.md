## Summary
**Goal:** Create a responsive, single-page marketing/landing site for “A1 Mart” with anchored section navigation, premium dark green + cream branding, and a working contact form.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single-page layout with a sticky top nav linking via in-page anchors to: Home, About, Products, Contact.
- Apply consistent “A1 Mart” styling (primary #1A4D2E, accent/background #F5EFE0) with bold typography, rounded cards/buttons, hover states, and cohesive spacing across sections.
- Implement the Home hero with the headline “Shop smart. Thousands of items.”, supporting copy, two CTA buttons (scroll to Products/Contact), and a highlighted panel featuring “Trusted by busy professionals” and “for business & beyond”.
- Implement the About section (“Our story & mission”) with the provided narrative (founded 2020, sustainability/fairness, mission) plus an adjacent “100% trusted” highlight card.
- Implement the Products section with exactly four category cards (Bags/Toys/Electronics/Clothing), each with an icon, subtitle, and starting prices (from $19/$9/$29/$15), plus a quality banner reading “100% genuine products — fast delivery — easy returns”.
- Implement the Contact section with a required-fields form that submits via POST to FormSubmit using the exact action URL and hidden fields provided, plus a note that messages go to merealam0786@gmail.com.
- Add a social links row with an Instagram button opening the exact provided URL in a new tab, plus optional placeholder buttons for X/Twitter and Facebook that do not break navigation.
- Add a simple responsive three-item informational highlight strip: “FAQ — fast answers”, “free shipping over $50”, “visit our showroom (by appt)”.
- Add a footer with the provided 2025 branding line, a palette note mentioning #1A4D2E and #F5EFE0, and a note that a logo will be provided later (use “A1” placeholder for now).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can scroll a polished A1 Mart landing page, use the sticky nav to jump between sections, view the four product categories and quality banner, and send messages through the working contact form (plus access Instagram via the social link).
