  "summary": "The diff clearly implements the sticky in-page navigation and the Home hero (headline, description, CTAs, and trust panel) plus a brand-themed Tailwind/CSS styling system. However, several required sections/content items (About narrative + trust card, Products exact cards/prices + quality banner, Contact FormSubmit exact hidden fields/redirect, social link exact Instagram URL, the 3-item info strip, and the footer’s exact required lines) cannot be confirmed from the truncated App.tsx. The diff also adds backend and Internet Identity/actor-query infrastructure that was not requested for this marketing site.",

      "requirement": "Build the About section (“Our story & mission”) with the provided narrative text and an adjacent trust highlight card (“100% trusted”).",
      "reason": "App.tsx is truncated before the About section content, so the required heading, three narrative paragraphs, and the “100% trusted” aside cannot be verified from the provided diff excerpt.",
